#  Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning
> Project for the course [Capita Selecta Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H05N0AE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idm1514848) at KU Leuven

TODO: Description of project.
# Proposal
1. Discuss how Reinforcement learning works (5 mins)
2. Discuss how neural networks work and in particular Convolutional neural nets (5 mins)
3. Discuss how we can combine these two topics into one.
4. Demo
5. What is after this? [Curious Reinforcment Learning](https://www.quantamagazine.org/clever-machines-learn-how-to-be-curious-20170919/)

## Installation

OS X & Linux:

```sh
command
```
-->

## Usage example

TODO: A few motivating and useful examples of how your product can be used. Spice this up with code blocks and potentially more screenshots.

```sh
command
```  

## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
TODO: What things you need to install the software and how to install them

    dep 1, dep 2, ... TODO

### Installing
TODO: A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Install the Python dependencies
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data
Load the data into a running MongoDB instance
```sh
mongorestore --drop -d cern_ldb --archive=data-cern/cern_ldb.mongodb.20170309.mki_v0_5.gz --gzip
```

The MongoDB dump archive was created as follows:
```sh
mongodump -d cern_ldb --archive=X.gz --gzip
```

## Built with
* [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) - The database used
* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) - Machine learning in Python
* ...
