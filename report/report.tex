\documentclass[12pt, conference, compsoc]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.

\usepackage{graphicx}





% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
For the course ``Capita selecta: Artificial Intelligence'' we received the subject of \emph{deep reinforcement learning}.
In this document we will explain everything we have done to get to know this subject. 
We will first start with our original plan we had for the demo, what we did with it and what eventually went wrong.
We will also mention the things we learned from this experience.
Then, we will explain to which other simulator we switched and how things went from there and which simulations we ran.
We will finish this document with the things we have learned whilst researching this subject.

\section{First simulator}
For our first simulator we maybe saw things a bit too big.
We wanted to showcase a really cool demo.
That's why we decided to do deep reinforcement learning with self driving cars since they are all over the news.
We quickly found some cool simulations online namely \emph{DeepTraffic}\cite{MIT:deeptraffic} with a corresponding MIT course available on youtube\cite{MIT:selfdriving-course} and a simulator written in Unity for a Udacity course\cite{Udacity-course} that we could use for our demo.
We decided to go with the latter for our demo but since the former was a bit easier to start with, we started with DeepTraffic to get to know our subject.

\subsection{DeepTraffic}
\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1in]{DeepTraffic.png}
\caption{The DeepTraffic simulator\cite{MIT:deeptraffic}}
\label{deep-traffic}
\end{figure}

The DeepTraffic simulator (which can be seen in figure \ref{deep-traffic}) is a simulator written in javascript that works in a browser.
The goal of the simulator is to make an agent that can swiftly maneuver between traffic without making collisions.
The agent's reward is based on its speed. A high speed means a high reward and a low speed means a low reward. 
The nice thing about DeepTraffic is that it also has a MIT course\cite{MIT:selfdriving-course} that explains a whole lot of things about self driving cars.
To prepare ourselves for the task we wanted to accomplish, we watched the full play list (only five video's in total) of this course available on youtube. 

Once we finished the playlist we started with an implementation for this simulator. We created two agents that could respectively go $67$ mph and $69$ mph. This was not the best speed of all time but for us it was a good way to get our feet wet with deep reinforcement learning. The lectures were also very informative about self driving cars. Once we finished this we decided to finally start with the demo we wanted to show.

\subsection{Unity self driving car simulator}
\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3in]{Udacity-Simulator}
\caption{The Unity simulator for the udacity ourse\cite{Udacity-course}}
\label{Udacity}
\end{figure}

For our original demo we planned to use the self driving car simulator in Unity that was written for a Udacity course\cite{Udacity-course}.
The goal of our demo would've been to create an agent that could ride between the lines on a track.
To do this we had to do some changes to this simulator since it was originally written to do behavioral cloning, this is where a human first shows the A.I. what to do and the agent then has to copy this behavior.
The changes were rather small, we added a extra text field on the UI and we added a way to know if the car was still on the track or not, we then had to make sure that the simulator could talk with our program.
This wasn't that hard since the simulator already had a way to send data to an external script by using websockets and the course provided a start template script written in python.
How the game world looked like can be seen on figure \ref{Udacity}.
\newline
\newline
We used Pytorch\cite{Pytorch} to create a implementation of the DQN. 
We spent quite some time on creating a good scoring function to describe the task we wanted to do. 
This step was necessary since the simulator didn't have a reward function. 
Which functions we tried and the ways our A.I. exploited these functions will be explained in the next section.
\subsubsection{Scoring functions}
An important part in reinforcement learning is the creating of a good scoring function. 
Every small unintended ``bug'' in a scoring function will be exploited by the agent so the creation of such a function should be done with care. We tried several scoring functions but we will describe here the two scoring functions in which the agent found actually a way to beat our intention!

The first scoring function that was exploited by our agent was a function based on lifetime having a higher weight than speed.
	Our idea was that if the agent would live as long as possible it would progress through the track. 
	\begin{displaymath}
touch\_track(speed + 10*time\_alive ) - 10*(1-touch\_track)
	\end{displaymath}	
Sadly enough this didn't really happen.
The agent quickly found out that just by standing still it would get the highest score!

For our second function we learned that giving more weight to the time alive was not beneficial.
That's why we created a new function where speed and time alive were as important.

\begin{displaymath}
touch\_track(speed * time\_alive ) - 10*(1-touch\_track)
\end{displaymath}
	
With this function the agent found that it could actually drive in a circle between the two lines of the track whilst still moving at a high velocity.

\subsubsection{Problems with the simulator}
Sadly we had to stop our efforts of trying to use this simulator for our demo.
After having spent too much time on scoring functions and getting the simulator up and running we came to the conclusion that the data from the simulator was not being sent fast enough.
This was due to the websocket implementation they used. 
We saw that the data would be buffered in-game and data would still be sent long time after we disabled the learning in the simulator.
We didn't immediately found a way to stop the simulation when a frame would be send (we're no Unity pro's) so we thought that if we would change the websockets to tcp we would've gotten maybe a stable data stream.
Since this was not assured we decided we've lost way too much time with this already and we decided to move on to our second simulator.
\section{Second simulator}
Obviously, for our second simulator we wanted to find something that would have a predefined scoring function such that we shouldn't spend too much time with that and also the game should wait for the input of the agent.
We stumbled upon the gym environment from OpenAI\cite{1802.09464}.
This environment has a extensive library of games playable for an A.I. from text games to even 3D games. 
\subsection{Implementation}
For the implementation we decided to use python and PyTorch \cite{PyTorch} again.
We started this implementation by closely following the nature paper\cite{mnih2015humanlevel}.
We sadly enough came across bugs that lasted for quite some hours to find. 
In the end we just started again from an empty file since we couldn't find these bugs and this time we got it right!
Our agent was finally learning on Pong!
We also implemented our agent in a notebook to make it more clear for people who would want to look at our implementation.
\subsection{Atari games}
In the human-level control through deep reinforcement paper they used Atari games that's why we wanted to test these games.
The Atari games that we tried are: Pong, Freeway, \textbf{Meer games testen}.

We found that for these games our agent took the following time to have a winning strategy.
\textbf{todo zet tabel in met alle waardes}.

\subsection{Other games}
The original paper was written by using Atari games, therefor we wanted to test it out for other games. 
We found a game called ``RocketLander''\cite{RocketLander} that resembles what SpaceX is doing now. The aim of the game is to land a space shuttle on a platform. We trained the agent for 24 hours but there was no real improvement in it's score. 
We then tried a flashgame called ``DuskDrive''

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
%
%\begin{figure}[!t]

%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.
%

%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells

%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline

%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
